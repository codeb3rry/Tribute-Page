    </h4>
    <p>  
      Early Life
    </p>
 <ul>
   <li><b>3 January 1892</b> Birth of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State (now part of South Africa).</li>
   <li><b>Autumn 1907</b> Tolkien probably invents his private language ‘Naffarin’ based on Spanish and Latin.</li>

   <li><b>17 December 1910</b> Tolkien obtains a scholarship at Oxford’s Exeter College.</li>
<li><b>Summer 1911</b> Tolkien becomes school librarian, and the T.C.B.S. (Tea Club and Barrovian Society) is formed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Oxford and Early Career</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>October 1911</b> Tolkien begins studying at Oxford.</li>
<li><b>1913 Tolkien</b> writes to Edith on his 21st birthday, and soon after they become engaged.</li>
<li><b>January 1914</b> Tolkien and Edith become betrothed after she is received into the Catholic Church.</li>
<li><b>24 September 1914</b> Tolkien writes his first identifiable “Middle-earth” fragment ‘The Voyage of Éarendel the Evening Star’.</li>
<li><b>25-6 Sep 1915</b> Final meeting of all four main members of the T.C.B.S. in Lichfield.</li>
<li><b>22 March 1916</b> Ronald and Edith are married in Warwick.</li>
<li><b>1 July 1916</b> Battle of the Somme begins. Rob Gilson, close friend and member of the T.C.B.S. dies.</li>
<li><b>9 November 1916</b> Suffering from trench fever, Tolkien returns to England.</li>
<li><b>3 December 1916</b> G.B. Smith, a member of the T.C.B.S., dies from wounds received 4 days earlier.</li>
<li><b>c. May 1917</b> Tolkien is inspired by watching Edith dance in a ‘hemlock’ glade near Roos. This is the germ for the meeting of Lúthien and Beren in his legendarium.</li>
<li><b>November 1918</b> The Tolkiens return to Oxford. Tolkien obtains employment with the New English Dictionary[Oxford English Dictionary]. Tolkien probably begins work on the first version of ‘The Music of the Ainur’.</li>
<li><b>Autumn 1920</b> He begins work as a Reader in English Language at Leeds University. Michael, the Tolkiens’ second son is born on 22 October.</li>
<li><b>21 November 1924</b> Christopher, the Tolkiens’ third son is born.</li>
<li><b>Autumn 1925</b> Tolkien takes up an appointment as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. He purchases a house in Oxford.</li>
<li><b>11 May 1926</b> First known meeting between C.S. Lewis and Tolkien, and they soon become friends.</li>
<li><b>December 1929</b> C.S. Lewis reads and critiques the Lay of Leithian.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and Academic Career</p>
    <ul>
<li><b>Summer 1930</b> About this time, Tolkien may have written the first sentence of The Hobbit: “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit“.</li>
<li><b>19-20 Sep 1931</b> Tolkien and Hugo Dyson talk with C.S. Lewis, who begins to shift from believing in God to accepting Christ. This event also inspires Tolkien to later write the poem ‘Mythopoeia’.</li>
<li><b>Late? 1932</b> Tolkien probably lends the typescript of The Hobbit to C.S. Lewis, which at this time ends with the death of Smaug.</li>
<li><b>Autumn 1933</b> The Inklings meetings under the auspices of C.S. Lewis become an important part of Tolkien’s social life.</li>
<li><b>Early 1936</b> Susan Dagnall of Allen & Unwin reads the unfinished manuscript of The Hobbit. She urges him to finish the narrative, and it is accepted for publication.</li>
<li><b>21 September 1937</b> The Hobbit is published. Because of its success, Stanley Unwin subsequently urges Tolkien to write a sequel, which he begins. This is the germ of The Lord of the Rings.</li>
<li><b>23 June 1945</b> Tolkien becomes Oxford’s Merton Professor of English Language and Literature.</li>
<li><b>Feb-Oct 1949</b> Tolkien types up The Lord of the Rings making corrections as he works.</li>

<li><b>Late 1951</b> Tolkien probably writes a long letter to Waldman explaining why The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings are indivisible and interconnected. During this year Tolkien probably works on a prose version of the later part of Narn i Chin Húrin from ‘The Return of Túrin’ to his death.</li>
<li><b>April 1952</b> Collins, the publishers, decline to publish The Lord of the Rings.</li>
